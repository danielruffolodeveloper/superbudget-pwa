## Summary
Money and cost of living is all the talk post 2022 Election here in Australia. Its never been more important than ever before to get a handle on personal finances.
Whilst this app is by no means the 1 stop solution, My hope is that through continuous development an trial of ideas, I can build a solution that makes builing budgets more enjoyable and less tedious.
I also will use this project to experament with all things React and Microfrontends!
