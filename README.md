# React Superbudget PWA
A React PWA for managing a budget effectively 

## Summary
Money and cost of living is all the talk post 2022 Election here in Australia. Its never been more important than ever before to get a handle on personal finances.
Whilst this app is by no means the 1 stop solution, My hope is that through continuous development an trial of ideas, I can build a solution that makes builing personal budgets easier.

## Feature Objective
### Stage 1 
 - Allow users create a budget spanning a period of 12 months
 - Allow users to add Incomes and Expenses to each budget and see live calculation of totals
 - Allow users to randomly seed a budget for demo purposes
 
## Technical Objective
### Stage 1
 - Leverage the PWA framework/tooling to allow users to add the application to their device homescreen
 - Adopt a local storage first approach to allow users to use the application without any cloud dependencies
 - Experiment with React Hooks for local storage and context
 - Implement unit and component testing using Jest
